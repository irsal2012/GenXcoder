## 🚀 Technical Architecture

### Collaboration Service Architecture

```typescript
CollaborationService {
  // Session Management
  createSession(projectId, name, settings) → Promise<Session>
  joinSession(sessionId) → Promise<Session>
  leaveSession() → Promise<void>
  
  // Real-time Communication
  sendMessage(content, type) → void
  sendCursorPosition(x, y, elementId) → void
  sendEdit(elementId, type, position, content) → void
  
  // Media Features
  startVoiceChat() → Promise<MediaStream>
  startScreenShare() → Promise<MediaStream>
  
  // Event System
  onUserJoined(handler) → void
  onMessage(handler) → void
  onEdit(handler) → void
}
```

### Component Integration

```
CollaborativeWorkspace
├── ConversationInterface (AI Chat)
├── TeamCollaboration (Team Features)
├── ProgressTracker (Shared Progress)
└── ResultsDisplay (Shared Results)
```

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Action → CollaborationService → Event Handlers → UI Updates
     ↓
Local Storage ← Session State → Real-time Sync
     ↓
Analytics ← User Patterns → Insights
```
